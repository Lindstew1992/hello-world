<h2>Skills</h2>

  Studying digital imaging, fundamentals of interactive design, visual storytelling, digital publishing, web publishing, 
  2-D animation, 3-D modeling and animation, digital illustration, design fundamentals, and portfolio design.
  For the past four years, I studied general courses and wanted to get an A.A. degree in Art. But, seeing that I wasn't going anywhere with it, I decided to go for an A.S. degree in Graphic Design. 
  Though I mostly enjoy classic Art, learning graphics doesn't seem too bad. I mean, it doesn't hurt to get with the times.

<h2>Software/Hardware</h2>
 
   For the hardware, I'm comfortable with using both the desktop, keyboard, hard disk, and mouse; it seems easy for me to move objects on the screen with the mouse and using the keyboard to
   type in information. As for software, I like to use Photoshop, Illustrator, Bridge, and InDesign for graphic designing. For animation I would use Adobe animate and Character Animator.
